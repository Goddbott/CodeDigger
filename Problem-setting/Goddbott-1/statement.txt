You are given a grid of width m and length n. The grid is made up of m*n boxes of dimensions 1*1. You are given a starting point (x1,y1) and an ending point (x2,y2).
You are only allowed to move 1 unit diagonally and 1 unit up. Every move by one unit takes 1 second. Find the minimum time it would take to reach the destination. If it is not possible then output -1.The problem contains T test cases.

Input Format: 
The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.
In each test case
The first line contains integers m,n denoting the width and length of the grid.
The second line contains integers x1,y1 and x2,y2 denoting the starting and ending points.

Output:
Print the minimum time taken to reach the destination in a single line. If not possible then print -1.3

Constraints:
1<= T <= 10^5
1<= m,n <= 10^9
1<= x1,x2 <= m
1<= y1,y2 <= n
