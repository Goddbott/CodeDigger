First we calculate the difference between the coordinates of starting point and ending point.
a= X2-X1 and b=Y2-Y1

One can observe that if a is greater than b or any of a or b is negative then it is impossible to reach the ending point.
If a is equal to b then one can directly move diagonally to reach the ending point in minimum time.
If a is less than b then we first move diagonally then move up to reach the ending point in minimum time.
